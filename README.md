#üéÆ Northcoders House of Games API üé≤

üïπÔ∏èGreetings and a warm welcome to my Games API project üïπÔ∏è

I've developed a backend service that serves as a hub for Games, delivering data and details to the frontend structure. This application can be interacted with programmatically, allowing clients/users to retrieve, submit, modify, and remove data.
You can also access my Games API live by clicking on this link üîó [Word to Link]([URL](https://mohamed-nc-game-backend.onrender.com/api) or by copying the following url to your browser üîó https://mohamed-nc-game-backend.onrender.com/api, which describes all the possible end points for this API.

To use and test this API please follow the steps below. Important Notes: You will need to have PostgreSQL v12.0 and Node.js v19.3.0 or later!
## Accessing the databases

To access the database, create two .env files for this project: '.env.test' and '.env.development'.
The following database name will need t be added as shown below:

    PGDATABASE=nc_games to the .env.development file and

    PGDATABASE=nc_games_test to the .env.test file

    add PGDATABASE=nc_games_test to the .env.test file


## Project Summary

This project is about creating a database regarding boardgames and interacting with the endpoints that we have regarding their reviews, comments and users.


## Instructions on how to use the data

To fork the repo, go to my github link and click fork, after you have forked it to your device, you'll need to install the following modules:-

- Dotenv
- Express
- pg
- pg-format
  and
- supertest

For testing purposes, I have also used jest, jest-extended and jest-sorted.

Before using the data, you'll need to setup the database by running npm run setup-dbs then npm run seed

To run the tests to see that the database is functioning correctly, run:-

- npm test for both files or
- npm test utils.test.js for the utility function
  or
- npm test app.test.js for the app and server endpoints.


## Minimum node version 16.x.x and psql version 14.x required
